# Autonomous Driving System Simulation

This project simulates an autonomous driving system using reinforcement learning. All the code for the simulation can be found in the `rl.ipynb` notebook.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains data files used in the simulation.
  - `points_of_interest_oulu_with_names.csv`: CSV file with points of interest.
  - `routes.json`: JSON file with route information.
- `datasimulate.py`: Python script for data simulation.
- `ors-route_normal.json`: JSON file with normal route information.
- `route_map.html`: HTML file for route map visualization.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required for the project.
- `rl.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the reinforcement learning simulation.
- `t-drive-trajectory-data-sample.bib`: Bibliography file for T-Drive trajectory data sample.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Open the rl.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to explore and run the simulation code.
